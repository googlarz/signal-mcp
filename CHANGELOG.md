# Changelog

All notable changes to signal-mcp are documented here.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-03

### New tools (9)
- `unblock_contact` — unblock a previously blocked contact
- `remove_contact` — remove a contact from local list
- `update_profile` — update your own Signal name, about text, or avatar
- `create_group` — create a new Signal group
- `join_group` — join a group via invite link
- `list_devices` — list all devices linked to your account
- `add_device` — link a new device
- `remove_device` — unlink a device by ID
- `get_own_number` — get the Signal number this server is running as

### Improvements
- `send_read_receipt` now also marks messages as read in local store
- `send_attachment` now saves a sent record to local store (conversation history)
- `install-service` / `uninstall-service` now work on both macOS (LaunchAgent) and Linux (systemd user unit)
- 36 MCP tools total

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-03

### Bug fixes
- `send_group_attachment` — was using wrong RPC method (`sendGroupMessage` instead of `send`) and passing `groupId` as a list instead of a string
- `get_conversation` — outgoing DMs were invisible; added `recipient` column to store with auto-migration for existing databases
- `get_unread` — was polling the network and filtering by a flag that was never set; now queries `is_read=0` messages from local store
- `react_to_message` — silently failed for groups; now accepts `group_id` parameter
- `send_read_receipt` — `recipient` must be an array per signal-cli JSON-RPC spec
- Desktop import — temp plaintext DB file could leak if message parsing raised an exception
- `history` / `search` CLI — were calling `ensure_daemon()` for store-only reads (slow, unnecessary)
- `send_attachment` — `~` and relative paths not expanded before sending to signal-cli

### New tools (2)
- `update_group` — rename a group, add/remove members, set disappearing message timer
- `set_expiration_timer` — set or disable disappearing messages for any DM or group

### New features
- `get_conversation` and `signal-mcp history` — new `since` parameter (ISO datetime or `YYYY-MM-DD`) to filter messages by date
- 27 MCP tools total

### Performance
- `init_db()` now runs only once per process (guarded by `_initialized` flag); no-op on repeat calls
- `detect_account()` result cached at module level — no repeated subprocess spawns
- `get_conversation` and `search_messages` no longer start the daemon (store-only reads)
- JSON-RPC request IDs now use an incrementing counter — no collision risk under concurrent calls

### Tests
- 99 tests total (was 74)
- Full `store.py` coverage: save, get_conversation (both directions), get_unread, mark_as_read, list_conversations, search, stats, schema migration
- RPC param shape tests for all fixed methods
- All tests use isolated temp databases — no global state leakage between tests
